# Storing incident documentation. 

Risk Analysis Template - https://goo.gl/bnsPj7

As an SRE, it is essential to have a central location to store post-mortems and document incidents. 

This location should be easily accessible to all members of the SRE team and other relevant stakeholders. Here are some steps to create this central location:

Choose a platform: Decide on a platform to store incident documentation, such as a wiki, shared drive, or incident management platform.

Define the incident template: Create a standardized template for documenting incidents. This template should include details such as the incident severity, time of occurrence, root cause, and resolution steps.

Establish access controls: Set up access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and edit incident documentation.

Create a post-mortem process: Establish a post-mortem process that requires teams to document all major incidents, regardless of severity. This process should also outline the steps for conducting a post-mortem analysis and documenting findings.

Encourage collaboration: Encourage collaboration among teams involved in incident management. This can include sharing incident documentation and post-mortem reports to foster cross-functional learning.
