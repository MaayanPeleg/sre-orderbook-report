# Backlog
Our backlog of implementations and improvements to our application can be found must not be forgotten, we need to wotk through the highets priority items first, and then work our way down the list.

## prioritised backlog
When a more severe or important item comes into our backlog, we need to use its priority level to determine where it should be placed in our backlog, and then work our way down the list. 

For example with our orderbook application, our history page ends up breaking the application, and therefore this is a high priority item, and therefore should be placed at the top of our backlog, as opposed ti implementing SLO's, or pipelines ECT. 

So if we were tasked with improving this appliation as a team of SRE/ DevOps engineers, we would first fix the history page, and then work our way down the list, creating SLI's, SLO's, SLA's, pipelines and other items.
