# Backlog
Our backlog of implementations and improvements to our application can be found must not be forgotten, we need to wotk through the highets priority items first, and then work our way down the list.

## prioritised backlog
When a more severe or important item comes into our backlog, we need to use its priority level to determine where it should be placed in our backlog, and then work our way down the list. 

For example with our orderbook application, our history page ends up breaking the application, and therefore this is a high priority item, and should be placed at the top of our backlog, as opposed ti implementing SLO's, or pipelines ECT. 

We need to isure we work through the backlog in order of priority, and not just in order of when we added the items to the backlog, as otherwise our application is likely to be more unstable and unreliable. For example, lets supose the within the last 5 minutes, we added a new SLI after an incident occured, that will alert us sooner if this incident occurs again. This item is a high priority, as it prevents future incidents, howerver as it was placed at the bottom of our backlog, we dont get to it before the incident occurs 2-3 more times. we need to ensure that we prioritise our backlog.

So if we were tasked with improving this appliation as a team of SRE/ DevOps engineers, we would first fix the history page, and then work our way down the list, creating SLI's, SLO's, SLA's, pipelines and other items.
